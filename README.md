# DDSLC - Dinamic Data Structure Library for C


  This project was developed for academic porposes, aiming to implement the most general types of data structure by a generic way, thus once it was implemented, it must be used for a large variety of applications, allowing us to avoid the needing to recreate a specific data structure for each data type in our projects.

  Null pointer is a powerful tool for achieve this goal. It can refereciate variables of any data type, offering a flexible way to manipulate differents data types through a same function. Basically, the ability for build generic data structures, turns around the knowledge of how to use null pointers allied to dinamic allocation technics.
